School Work
============
This repository contains projects that I have 
worked on as part of my Masters Degree in 
Computer Engineering while at Syracuse University. 
For Hardware designs provided they are most likely 
laid-out in KiCAD 4.0+ and can be opened with that 
software. All code is provided AS IS and some 
code contains bugs that I never had time to fix 
while working on the project for the class. If 
you are a SU student who has found this please 
note that use of this code for school projects 
is a violation of the University Academic 
Integrity policy and could result in a referral 
to the Academic Integrity Review Board.
